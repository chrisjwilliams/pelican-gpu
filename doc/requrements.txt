Use of GPUs
===========

- Must be able to assign GPU resources to modules via the configuration file
  - Modules can be assigned fixed resources
- Modules inside a pipeline must be able to write to and fetch from GPU memory
  only those GPU's to which it has been assigned access to.
- Assignment can be dynamic and may change depending on computational requirements.
- Provision shall be made to allow copying the same memory to multiple GPU's
- The design shall not restrict the ability of algorithms that require its
  assigned GPU's to talk to each other directly, without passing through CPU memory.
- Both CUDA and openCL shall be supported, with a common api for all functionality.
